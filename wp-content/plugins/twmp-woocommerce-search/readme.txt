TWMP WooCommerce Search
=======================

Shortcode: [twmp_woocommerce_search]

Description:
- Adds a small AJAX-powered product search input for WooCommerce which shows a popup with up to 5 results after typing at least 3 characters.

Usage:
1. Install and activate the plugin in your WordPress site.
2. Insert the shortcode [twmp_woocommerce_search] where you want the form to appear (e.g., in a widget, block, or page).
3. Optional attributes: min_chars and max_results, for example: [twmp_woocommerce_search placeholder="Tìm nhanh..." min_chars="2" max_results="10"]

Notes:
- Requires WooCommerce to be activated. If WooCommerce is not active, a notice is shown instead of the form.
- The shortcode accepts an optional attribute: placeholder. Example: [twmp_woocommerce_search placeholder="Tìm nhanh..."]
